# springboot-microservices-project


Summary

This project  develop a Spring Boot application using microservices architecture, covering various architectural patterns and technologies like service discovery, distributed tracing, and centralized logging. It focuses on building different services like the product, order, inventory, and notification services, and provides a solution architecture diagram. 


Detail Working
The project covers developing a Spring Boot application using a microservices architecture, explaining various architectural patterns like service discovery, distributed tracing, and centralized logging using Spring Cloud technologies. It focuses on building different services such as product, order, inventory, and notification services and provides a solution architecture diagram showcasing the communication between services and other components like API Gateway, configuration server, and Keycloak. The project demonstrates the development of the product service, including configuring MongoDB and creating necessary classes like the product model, repository, and controller. It also showcases writing integration tests using TestContainers for the product service and encourages readers to implement integration tests for other endpoints while developing the order service.

Emphasizing the importance of prior knowledge of Spring Boot and microservices architecture, the project highlights the significance of architectural patterns like service discovery, distributed tracing, and centralized logging in building a robust and scalable microservices architecture. The provided solution architecture diagram helps visualize the overall structure and communication flow between services and other components, aiding in better understanding and implementation. The project's focus on the development of the product service provides a step-by-step guide on configuring MongoDB, creating necessary classes, and writing integration tests using TestContainers. By encouraging readers to implement integration tests for other endpoints while developing the order service, the project promotes a comprehensive testing approach for all services in the microservices project.

It showcases the usage of the Spring Boot framework, specifically the creation of a REST controller and implementation of a web client to make HTTP requests to another service, highlighting the importance of communication between services in a microservices architecture. Additionally, it emphasizes the need for an event-driven architecture and demonstrates how to implement it using Kafka, enabling asynchronous communication between microservices through events, which helps decouple services and provides fault tolerance and scalability.
